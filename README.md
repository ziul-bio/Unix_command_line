# Luiz Carlos Vieira
<sub> *A Biologist*  seeking to improve your knowledge in biology throughout by bioinformatics </sub>

Graduated in Biological Sciences and Master in Sciences from the Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology and Pathogenic Bioagents.
I Worked as a Laboratory Technician (Trainne) and Researcher (Master's Student) at the Virology Research Center (USP).
Most recently, worked as a Laboratory Analyst in the biological quality control, performing quality control tests on viral vaccines.
Nowaday days, works as an independent biological data analyst/bioinformatician.

**Background in:** Cell and molecular Biology, virology, genomics, Python, R, linux, data analysis.

## About this Project:

*  [WSL2](https://github.com/ziul-bio/bash_Unix_Conda/blob/main/1-WSL2_Install_and_Reclaim_disk_space.md) is an optional feature available for Windows 10 and 11 that allows you to run Linux (binary) programs and scripts directly on Windows. 
This way, it is possible that we have access to a Linux terminal inside Windows. As many tools developed for bioinformatics are built natively for Unix systems,
we will install WSL to take advantage of these programs. 

* [Conda](https://github.com/ziul-bio/bash_Unix_Conda/blob/main/2-conda_envs_setup.md) is a tool for manage environments and packages, very usefull whem we need to work with diferent versions os programming languages and softwares

* [Bash_Unix_command_line](https://github.com/ziul-bio/bash_Unix_Conda/blob/main/3-bash_Unix_commands.md) Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software.
It has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions. A version is also available for Windows 10 and 11 via WSL.
Here, I share a list of most used commands, to make ours lives a bit easier in the daily basis, when working in the command line. 

* Feel free to use all and share some contribuition to improve them too.
