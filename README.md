## About this Project:

*  WSL is an optional feature available for Windows 10 and 11 that allows you to run Linux (binary) programs and scripts directly on Windows. 
   This way, it is possible that we have access to a Linux terminal inside Windows. As many tools developed for bioinformatics are built natively
   for Unix systems, we will install WSL to take advantage of these programs. 

*  Feel here to use all and share some contribuition to improve them too.
